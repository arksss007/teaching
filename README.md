# teaching - resources for Cuemacro courses

In this repo, we have resources for Cuemacro courses (including Python for finance taught on QDC), such as how to install Anaconda, PyCharm etc.

For more information about my Python for finance workshops, please contact saeed@cuemacro.com

For instructions on how to install Anaconda and PyCharm see [Installing Anaconda and PyCharm](pythoncourse/installation/installing_anaconda_and_pycharm.ipynb)
