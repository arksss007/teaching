We'll also be installing a lot of other useful libraries for machine learning, natural language processing etc. We'll also make other suggestions so you can do financial data analysis, such as making sure that your firewalls allow access to sites like Quandl."

    "### Direct compute on a paid Azure Jupyter instance (Data Science Virtual Machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "The free version of Azure notebooks has a number of limitations. In particular, that it resets every hour and only has 4GB RAM. You can instead create paid instances Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux (Ubuntu) on Azure (DSVM), which is a Linux box for a number of different CPUs/RAM which are much more powerful. You can configure the machine as want, and the configuration will be stored for as long as you have the instance. Do make sure to power down the machine, once you are finished using it. This won't wipe the hard disk, but it will mean you aren't paying for it when it's idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst Azure 3.6 ML from the DSVM already has many libraries installed, eg. TensorFlow etc. You will still need to install additional Python libraries, but this can be done once. Script `update_azure_conda_env.sh` will attempt to install these extra libraries such as NLTK etc. and also a version of Pandas which should be more compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then connect your Azure notebook to run on this server via \"Direct compute\", where you need to specify the IP of the machine. At https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notebooks/use-data-science-virtual-machine it gives details on how to do \"Direct compute\" on your Azure Notebook. If you get a powerful machine you should be able to host multiple users. However, you should add usernames/passwords for every user if you do this, so each user runs in their own instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to run `conda install ipykernel` to make a new conda environment appear in the Jupyter notebook. Make sure that you select the right Python kernel from the Jupyter menu (Kernel / Change Kernel)."
